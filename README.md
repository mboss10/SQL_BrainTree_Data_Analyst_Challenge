# SQL BrainTree Data Analyst Challenge

I am always up for a challenge, especially when it is data related, and even more when it is required to use SQL to go through it!!

## Context

Alexander Connelly, shared in his [Github repository](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst) what is/used to be a Data Analyst exercise given during interviews at Braintree. <br><br>
It is composed of a series of 7 questions to answer using a dataset with continents, countries and GDP per capita data. Below, I will share my SQL code and comments to answer each question as best as I can.

## Dataset
Let's review each .csv file provided for that challenge.
### countries.csv
#### Definition
The file contains the list of countries: 252 rows, 2 columns `country_code` and `country_name`
